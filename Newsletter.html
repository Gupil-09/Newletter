        <h2>2. The French left faces a reality check over 90% wealth tax and lavish spending</h2>

        <h3>
            France’s left-wing coalition could break French and EU law with its proposed radical programme for government that includes a 90 per cent tax on the rich and a series of high-spending policies.
            The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats in the parliamentary elections on Sunday with 188 seats, ahead of President Emmanuel Macron’s Ensemble alliance on 161, but this is still far from a majority. 
            The far-right National Rally, which came top in the first round, fell to third place with 142.
            France has been plunged into uncertainty following the snap elections as parties vie over who will become Prime Minister, and the make-up of the government.

        <h2>3. ‘Ukraine’s future is in Nato, path to membership irreversible’</h2>

        <h3>
            The US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) has declared that Ukraine’s path to membership of the Trans-Atlantic military alliance is “irreversible”, and termed Russia as the “the most significant and direct 
            threat” to the security of the bloc’s member-states.In the Washington Declaration Summit, issued during Nato’s milestone 75th anniversary meeting in the US capital on Wednesday, Nato members also patted themselves on 
            the back for undertaking the “biggest reinforcement of our collective defence in a generation”, strengthening the alliance’s “deterrence and defence posture” with a mix of “nuclear, conventional, and missile defence 
            capabilities, complemented by space and cyber capabilities”, and spending more on defence. The declaration also saw a commitment to strengthen the defence industry across Europe and North America, and a warning that 
            rising hybrid threats could escalate to a point that invited collective defence arrangements.

        <h2>4. Elon Musk reacts to SpaceX launch destroying 9 bird nests: ‘I will refrain from having…’</h2>

        <h3>
            Journalist Mike Pesca took to X to slam an article published in a reputed newspaper about Elon Musk’s SpaceX launch. The news detailed that the launch destroyed several bird nests, and the journalist slammed the 
            newspaper for making it the “most important” news of the day. The SpaceX owner reacted to the post with a hilarious comment.“If you aren't familiar with the grammar of the Times front page layout here it is: The top 
            right story is the lead story, the top left story is the sub-lead everything else above the fold is the important news of the day. Today the New York Times says the second most important story is mounting pressure from 
            senior congressional Dems to push Biden out of the race. The 3rd most important story is a shocking French election results upending all expectations. The MOST important story is Elon Musk's successful space launch 
            destroying nine bird nests,” Pesca wrote.

            into a hippo's jaws. Many social media users have urged the authorities to take strict action against the man. The incident took place at Safari Park in West Java, Indonesia. In the viral footage, a hippo is seen at the 
            edge of its enclosure in the water, with its mouth open. A person is seen attempting to feed a carrot to the animal from a car near the enclosure. However, another passenger in the car throws a plastic bag into the hippo's
            mouth, and the animal begins chewing it.
